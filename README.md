# Word-Count
Software that helps you meet targets when typing.
## To Install
1) Download everything inside the debug folder
2) Ensure any files you want the program to use are labelled as Draft x _where x is the version number_

       In a future update you may be able to pick the filename.
  
3) These files must be stored in the same place as everything from the debug folder
4) Ensure when using the program for the first time that output.csv only includes the headers and is otherwise empty
5) To run double click on the `Word Count.exe` file
